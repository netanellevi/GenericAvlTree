# GenericAvlTree

This is a generic class of the data structure "Avl Tree".
It can be used to maintain an Avl Tree of any objects that provide a unique id to each of them.

You can include the header of the class and implement the "getValueFunc" that match your objects.

The file main.c shows how to use it along with a short tester.

HAVE FUN!
